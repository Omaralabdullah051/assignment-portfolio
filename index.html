            <h1>Be Aware About <span>Mental Health</span></h1>
            <p>Social media can have significant effects on various mental health concerns, such as depression,
                anxiety,
                addictions, and insomnia.

                Social media has become tremendously common over the past decade. A majority of people report using
                some
                type of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, at least once per day.

                According to recent data, as many as 90% of young adults currently spend time on social media
                sites.2
                This figure has increased nearly nine-fold since 2005, where only 12.5% reported frequent time spent
                on
                social media platforms.
                With such a rise in the use of social media, many researchers have begun investigating its effects
                on
                mental health.

                Disorders such as depression and anxiety have been very common in the past several decades. Amongst
                adults in the United States, approximately 7% of adults are affected by depression each year, while
                18%
                are reported to be affected by anxiety.

                Among the younger population, reports of mental health problems are particularly disturbing.Some
                data
                suggest, for instance, that 30% of college students are affected by depression, while 58% of
                counselling
                centers in the United States witnessed an increase in students seeking help for depression.
